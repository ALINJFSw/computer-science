Hi im ALINJ
hello who is there...

i used html and css to build this project 

this project created at 2/12/2023 

Note : this is the last version so i won't update this cs i im working for new exiting and profetional projects

to learn html and css the best way is practice alone without google ;)

the best way that helped me to learn especialy is copying sites or component and my big helper is a extention called (Grepper) don't tell anybody its a secret ðŸ¤«
note : im practicing in english so skip the Typo
